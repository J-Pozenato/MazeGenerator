# MazeGenerator     [Work in Progress]
Recursive Maze Generator with visual feedback where you can see the code generating the maze.

At the start page you can choose the height and width of the maze.

Right now the grid of the maze is created and everything is working fine until the constroctor has to retreat to a previously visited cell, then everything just stop working.
